Addressing the critical issue of stress, especially prevalent among IT professionals subjected to intense work pressures, this project introduces a pioneering stress detection system leveraging the advanced capabilities of 
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. With a focus on the tech industry's demanding environments, our solution is designed to identify stress and a wide array of 
emotional states including happiness, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, surprise, and neutrality through both photo uploads and live webcam feeds, enabling real-time emotional health assessments. This approach not only 
facilitates the immediate detection of stress in typical professional settings but also offers customized recommendations for overcoming stress and emotional challenges. By combining the technical prowess of 
CNNs with the comprehensive data of the FER dataset, the system provides actionable insights and support to IT workers, aiming to mitigate workplace stress and enhance overall well-being and productivity. This 
innovative method underscores the project's commitment to improving the mental health landscape for IT professionals through technology-driven solutions, offering a significant step forward in the proactive 
management of stress and emotional well-being in high-pressure environments.
